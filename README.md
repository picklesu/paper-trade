# Paper Trade

A paper trading simulator that runs 24/7 on simulated market data.

- `backend/`: Python + FastAPI (REST under `/api`, WebSocket stream at `/ws`)
- `frontend/`: React + TypeScript + Vite (proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend)

## How the simulated market works

- Prices are synthetic. Tickers are familiar names, but prices start from fixed values and move by a seeded random model (geometric Brownian motion), so they are not real quotes.
- Symbols move together through a shared market factor, plus their own noise.
- The market switches between **Calm**, **Normal** and **Volatile** regimes (shown in the top bar).
- **Session hours, without the wait:** the market trades 9:30 AM–4:00 PM ET, Monday–Friday. At the close it continues straight from the next session's open (with an overnight gap), so whenever you use the app the market is open. Exchange holidays are not modeled.
- Use the top-bar controls to pause or run at 1×, 10×, 60× or 600×.
- **Go to…** jumps to any date and time:
  - **Forward** fast-forwards the market through the skipped sessions.
  - **Back** asks whether to **replay the same prices** or **generate a new future** from that point. Prices are reproducible, so a replay is exact.
  - **Before the market's history** starts a brand-new market on that date.
- Restarting the backend restarts the market at the next real-world open. (Saving state comes in Phase 2b.)

## Run

```bash
./server.sh on        # start backend + frontend in the background, then open http://localhost:5173
./server.sh off       # stop both
./server.sh restart   # stop, then start
./server.sh status    # show what's running
./server.sh logs      # follow the logs (Ctrl+C stops following, not the servers)
```

The servers keep running after you close the terminal. Logs are in `.run/`.
To run in the foreground with logs in the terminal instead, use `./dev.sh`.

## Test

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest
cd frontend && npm test
```
